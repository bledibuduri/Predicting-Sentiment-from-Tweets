# Predicting Sentiment from Tweets  

## Overview  
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment of tweets from the Twitter platform. The sentiment classification is performed using a Naive Bayes classifier, which is trained on a dataset of tweets labeled as positive or negative.  

## Dependencies  
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:  
- `nltk`  
- `sklearn`  
- `numpy` (if used in preprocessing)  

You can install them using pip:  
```bash  
pip install nltk scikit-learn
